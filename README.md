# Custom Components

Custom components is an app which is composed of several individual custom components develop all by myself (Luis Espinosa) to demostrate how to build a component from others, taking them together to form a Datatable with some advantages. it was developed using HTML, CSS3+, Yarn, ReactJS, StyledComponents, ReactIcons and for the tests Jest,  React testing library and Mock Service Worker (mock API Calls in tests). It was written using the best practices for instance, a component oriented approach, UX Design rule (60% 30% 10%), variables, REMs, Responsiveness, mobile first approach, good tests coverage, mocked api calls in tests and more...
